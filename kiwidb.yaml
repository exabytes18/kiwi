# For local testing, it's good practice to bind only to 127.0.0.1.
# For multi-host deployments, make sure to bind to either the machine's IP or a wildcard address
# (e.g. 0.0.0.0).

# Note: the port will default to 12312 if not specified.

# All servers participating in the cluster must be identified and listed here. Quorum majority
# is determined by the hosts listed here. When changing this value for an operating cluster,
# you must ensure that all possible majority combinations of the new value must contain at least
# a majority hosts of the old value.
#
# Legal Change:
#     Old value: hosts: [1,2,3]
#     New value: hosts: [1,2,3,4]
#
#     New value majority combinations:
#         1,2,3,4 -> ok, since 1,2,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         1,2,3 ->   ok, since 1,2,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         1,2,4 ->   ok, since 1,2 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         1,3,4 ->   ok, since 1,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         2,3,4 ->   ok, since 2,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#
# Illegal Change:
#     Old value: hosts: [1,2,3]
#     New value: hosts: [1,2,3,4,5]
#
#     New value majority combinations:
#         1,2,3,4,5 -> ok, since 1,2,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         1,2,3,4 ->   ok, since 1,2,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         1,2,3 ->     ok, since 1,2,3 are majority of old values ([1,2,3])
#         ...
#         3,4,5 ->     bad, since 3 is not a majority of the old values ([1,2,3])
#
#     Since [3,4,5] is a majority of the new value, but does not contain a majority of the
#     old value, this can lead to inconsistency.
